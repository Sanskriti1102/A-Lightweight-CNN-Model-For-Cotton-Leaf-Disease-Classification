## 🔰 Introduction

This project implements a **lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for the classification of **cotton leaf diseases**—specifically *bacterial blight*, *cotton curl virus*, and *fusarium wilt*. The goal is to assist farmers and agronomists with fast, accurate, and affordable disease detection using image-based AI.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Traditional plant disease detection relies heavily on manual inspection, which can be slow and unreliable. This research:

- ✅ Enables **early diagnosis** to reduce crop loss  
- ✅ Promotes **cost-effective**, AI-powered agriculture  
- ✅ Supports **field-level implementation** on low-resource devices

## 🗂 Dataset Used

A custom dataset of high-resolution cotton leaf images labeled for:

- **Bacterial Blight**  
- **Cotton Curl Virus**  
- **Fusarium Wilt**

Images were preprocessed using resizing, normalization, denoising, and augmentation for improved training efficiency.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📦 **TensorFlow / Keras** for CNN model design  
- 📊 **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data analysis & visualization  
- 🔍 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

---

## 📈 Results

- 🧠 **Accuracy**: 96.6% on the test set  
- 🧪 **Validated Metrics**: Precision, recall, and F1-score > 95%  
- ⚡ **Lightweight Deployment**: Designed for Raspberry Pi, smartphones, or low-spec machines

## 🚀 Future Scope

This project opens up several future possibilities:

- 🌱 **Transfer Learning**: Use of pre-trained models to further improve accuracy with fewer data  
- 🌐 **IoT Integration**: Deploy with sensors and drones for automated disease monitoring in large-scale farms  
- 📱 **Mobile App Integration**: Build real-time plant disease detection tools accessible to farmers  
- 📈 **Expanded Dataset**: Include more disease classes and real-world field images for increased generalization  
- 🛰 **Satellite + AI Fusion**: Combine remote sensing data with CNN outputs for regional disease prediction
